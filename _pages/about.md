## Short bio
Dinesh Krishnamoorthy is an Assistant professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at [TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mechanical-engineering/), where he is a part of the [Control Systems Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/control-systems-technology/) group. 

He was a post-doctoral researcher at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Dinesh received his PhD in Process Systems Engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), MSc in Control Systems from Imperial College London, and B.Eng in Mechatronics from the University of Nottingham. 

Dinesh also has more than four years of industrial research experience. He was working as a Senior Researcher at Statoil Research centre, Norway between 2012-2016, and was also a part-time Senior Data Science consultant for Novo Nordisk R&D (2021). 

Dinesh is the recipient of the [Dimitirs. N. Chorafas Foundation Award](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/feinberg/sites/feinberg/files/uploads/files/chorafas_winners_2020_by_year_and_univeristy.pdf) (as one of 35 worldwide), [Excellence in Computer-Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) PhD Award](https://www.wp-cape.eu/index.php/outstanding-phd-thesis-on-cape/) by the European Federation of Chemical Engineers (EFCE), [NTNU Faculty of Natural Sciences Best PhD Thesis Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuHFnoTiy-k&ab_channel=NTNUFakultetfornaturvitenskap), as well as IFAC Young author award. 

His research interests include distributed optimization, numerical optimal control, real-time optimization, and Bayesian optimization, with applications to energy systems.
