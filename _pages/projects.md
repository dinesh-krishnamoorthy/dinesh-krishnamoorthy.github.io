  <summary> Project 1: Multiagent Black-box optimization </summary>
  
  
 

Multiagent decision-making arises where a collection of agents collaborate to achieve a common goal. Such problems commonly arise in many smart infrastructure systems such as in collaborative robotics, vehicle fleets, eco industrial parks etc. Here each agent takes its own local decision, but the agentâ€™s actions and decisions may be inter-dependent through common variables or shared constraints.  

Distributed optimization facilitate such a collection of agents to coordinate their actions to global optimality with only limited information sharing. Traditional distributed optimization methods requires detailed models in each subsystem. However, obtaining accurate models may be challenging in many complex engineering systems. Black-box optimization is a purely data-driven alternative that enables us to learn the optimum by interacting with the environment and observing the cost and constraints. Bayesian optimization (BO) is one such data-driven black-box optimization scheme, where the optimum is learned by sequentially interacting with the system. Despite the popularity of Bayesian optimization within AI and computer science domain, a decomposable Bayesian optimization framework for multi-agent systems has not been widely studied.

The main aim of this project is to develop a decomposable Bayesian optimization framework for multi-agent systems. Different decomposition strategies, as well as different Bayesian optimization schemes will be investigated, with application to a vehicle platooning problem and/or integrated energy system.

Tasks
*	Literature study on distributed optimization and Bayesian optimization
*	Formulate a decomposable Bayesian optimization framework 
*	Investigate different decomposition strategies 
*	Perform simulation studies on a vehicle platooning problem.

Prerequisites
*	Passionate about optimization and willingness to explore and learn new concepts 
*	Basic understanding of optimization (it would help if you have taken the 4DM20 course).
